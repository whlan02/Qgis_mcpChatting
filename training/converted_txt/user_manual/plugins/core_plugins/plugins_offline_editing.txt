Offline Editing Plugin
For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a cell
phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the changes need to
be synchronized with the master datasource (e.g., a PostGIS database). If several
persons are working simultaneously on the same datasets, it is difficult to
merge the edits by hand, even if people donâ€™t change the same features.
The  Offline Editing Plugin automates the
synchronisation by copying the content of the datasource
to a SpatiaLite or GeoPackage database and storing the offline edits to dedicated
tables. After being connected to the network again, it is possible to apply the
offline edits to the master dataset.
To use the plugin:

Open a project with some vector layers (e.g., from an Esri Shapefile, PostGIS
or WFS-T datasource).

Assuming you have already enabled the plugin (see :ref:`core_and_external_plugins`)
go to :menuselection:`Database --> Offline Editing -->` 
:guilabel:`Convert to offline project`. The eponym dialog opens.

Select the :guilabel:`Storage type`. It can be of :guilabel:`GeoPackage` or
:guilabel:`SpatiaLite` database type.

Use the :guilabel:`Browse` button to indicate the location of the database
in which to store the :guilabel:`Offline data`. It can be an existing file or
one to create.

In the :guilabel:`Select remote layers` section, check the layers you'd like to
save. The content of the layers is saved to database tables.

Note
Since target database formats do not have native list support, the offline
editing plugin transforms {string, number} list fields into string fields where
values are separated by commas. This allows reading and edit of the contents
of those fields when offline.
If you would like to handle both the field from the original layer and
the offline layer, you can rely on the :ref:`try() <expression_function_Conditionals_try>`
and :ref:`array <array_functions>` expression functions, e.g.:

try(array_contains("field",1),array_contains(string_to_array("field"),1))



You can check  :guilabel:`Only synchronize selected features if a
selection is present` allowing to only save and work on a
subset. It can be invaluable in case of large layers.
This is all!

Save your project and bring it on the field.

Edit the layers offline.

After being connected again, upload the changes using :menuselection:`Database
--> Offline Editing -->`  :guilabel:`Synchronize`.



Note
Layers that are used offline are marked with the 
icon in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel.
