Geometry Checker Plugin
Geometry Checker is a powerful core plugin to check and fix the geometry
validity of a layer. It is available from the :menuselection:`Vector`
menu ( :menuselection:`Check Geometries...`).

Configuring the checks
The :guilabel:`Check Geometries` dialog shows different grouped settings in the
first tab (:guilabel:`Setup`):

:guilabel:`Input vector layers`: to select the layers to check. A 
:guilabel:`Only selected features` checkbox can be used to restrict the
checking to the geometries of the selected features.
:guilabel:`Allowed geometry types` gives the chance to restrict the geometry
type of the input layer(s) to:
 Point
 Multipoint
 Line
 Multiline
 Polygon
 Multipolygon


:guilabel:`Geometry validity`. Depending on geometry types you can choose
between:
 :guilabel:`Self intersections`
 :guilabel:`Duplicate nodes`
 :guilabel:`Self contacts`
 :guilabel:`Polygon with less than 3 nodes`.


:guilabel:`Geometry properties`. Depending on geometry types, different
options are available:
 :guilabel:`Polygons and multipolygons may not contain any holes`
 :guilabel:`Multipart objects must consist of more than one part`
 :guilabel:`Lines must not have dangles`


:guilabel:`Geometry conditions`. Allows you to add some condition to validate
the geometries with:
 :guilabel:`Minimal segment length (map units)` 
 :guilabel:`Minimum angle between segment (deg)` 
 :guilabel:`Minimal polygon area (map units sqr.)` 
 :guilabel:`No sliver polygons` with a :guilabel:`Maximum thinness`
 and a  :guilabel:`Max. area (map units sqr.)`



:guilabel:`Topology checks`. Depending on geometry types, many different
options are available:
 :guilabel:`Checks for duplicates`
 :guilabel:`Checks for features within other features`
 :guilabel:`Checks for overlaps smaller than` 
 :guilabel:`Checks for gaps smaller than` 
 :guilabel:`Points must be covered by lines`
 :guilabel:`Points must properly lie inside a polygon`
 :guilabel:`Lines must not intersect any other lines`
 :guilabel:`Lines must not intersect with features of layer`

 :guilabel:`Polygons must follow boundaries of layer` 


:guilabel:`Tolerance`. You can define the tolerance of the check in map layer
units.
:guilabel:`Output vector layer` gives the choice to:
 :guilabel:`Modify input layer`
 :guilabel:`Create new layers`



When you are happy with the configuration, you can click on the :guilabel:`Run`
button.


The Geometry Checker Plugin

The Geometry Checker Plugin can find the following errors:

Self intersections: a polygon with a self intersection
Duplicate nodes: two duplicates nodes in a segment
Holes: hole in a polygon
Segment length: a segment length lower than a threshold
Minimum angle: two segments with an angle lower than a threshold
Minimum area: polygon area lower than a threshold
Silver polygon: this error come from very small polygon (with small area) with
a large perimeter
Duplicates features
Feature within feature
Overlaps: polygon overlapping
Gaps: gaps between polygons

The following figure shows the different checks made by the plugin.


Some checks supported by the plugin



Analysing the results
The results appear in the second tab (:guilabel:`Result`) and as an overview
layer of the errors in the canvas (its name has the default prefix
:file:`checked_`).
A table lists the :guilabel:`Geometry check result` with one error per row and
columns containing: the layer name, an ID, the error type, then the coordinates
of the error, a value (depending on the type of the error) and finally the
resolution column which indicates the resolution of the error.
At the bottom of this table, you can :guilabel:`Export` the error into different file
formats. You also have a counter with the number of total errors and fixed ones.
You can select a row to see the location of the error. You can change this
behavior by selecting another action between  :guilabel:`Error`
(default),  :guilabel:`Feature`, 
:guilabel:`Don't move`, and  :guilabel:`Highlight selected features`.
Below the zoom action when clicking on the table row, you can:

 :guilabel:`Show selected features in attribute table`
 :guilabel:`Fix selected errors using default resolution`
 :guilabel:`Fix selected errors, prompt for resolution method`
You will see a window to choose the resolution's method among which:
Merge with neighboring polygon with longest shared edge
Merge with neighboring polygon with largest area
Merge with neighboring polygon with identical attribute value, if any, or
leave as is
Delete feature
No action


 :guilabel:`Error resolution settings` allows you to change the
default resolution method depending on the error type


Tip
Fix multiple errors
You can fix multiple errors by selecting more than one row in the table with
the CTRL + click action.

Finally, you can choose which :guilabel:`Attribute to use when merging features
by attribute value`.
