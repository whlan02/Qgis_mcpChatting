The 3D Map Item
The 3D Map item is used to display a :ref:`3D map view <label_3dmapview>`.
Use the  :guilabel:`Add 3D Map` button, and follow
:ref:`items creation instructions <create_layout_item>` to add a new
3D Map item that you can later manipulate the same way as demonstrated
in :ref:`interact_layout_item`.
By default, a new 3D Map item is empty.
You can set the properties of the 3D view and customize it in the
:guilabel:`Item Properties` panel.
In addition to the
:ref:`common properties <item_common_properties>`, this feature
has the following functionalities (:numref:`figure_layout_3dmap_prop`):
