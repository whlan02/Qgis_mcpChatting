Working with 3D Tiles

What are 3D Tiles?
3D tiles are specification for streaming and rendering large-scale 3D
geospatial datasets. They use a hierarchical structure to efficiently manage
and display 3D content, optimising performance by dynamically loading
appropriate levels of detail. This technology is widely used in urban
planning, architecture, simulation, gaming, and virtual reality, providing
a standardised and interoperable solution for visualising complex geographical data.


Example of 3D tiles

Currently, QGIS supports two formats of 3D tiles:

Cesium 3D tiles,
used primarily for complex 3D models of buildings or whole cities.
Such datasets can be provided by cloud-based platforms such as Cesium Ion
or Google (Photorealistic 3D Tiles).
Quantized Mesh tiles,
used for terrain elevation data.

See :ref:`3d_tiles` for instructions on how to add these data sources to QGIS.


3D Tiles Properties
The 3D tiles :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog provides the following sections:







 :ref:`Information <3dtilesinformationmenu>`
 :ref:`Source <3dtilessourcemenu>`
 :ref:`Symbology <3dtilessymbologymenu>`[1]

 :ref:`3D View <3dtiles3dviewmenu>`[1]
 :ref:`Rendering <3dtilesrenderingmenu>`
 :ref:`Elevation <3dtileselevationmenu>`[1]

 :ref:`Metadata <3dtilesmetadatamenu>`
 
 



[1] Also available in the :ref:`Layer styling panel <layer_styling_panel>`

Information Properties
The :guilabel:`Information` tab is read-only and represents an interesting
place to quickly grab summarized information and metadata on the current layer.
Provided information are:

based on the provider of the layer: name, URL, source type and path, number
of zoom levels
custom properties, used to store in the active project additional information about the layer.
More properties can be created and managed using PyQGIS, specifically through
the :pyqgis:`setCustomProperty() <qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.setCustomProperty>` method.
the Coordinate Reference System: name, units, method, accuracy, reference
(i.e. whether it's static or dynamic)
picked from the :ref:`filled metadata <3dtilesmetadatamenu>`: access,
extents, links, contacts, history...



Source Properties
The  :guilabel:`Source` tab displays basic information about
the selected 3D tile, including:

the :guilabel:`Layer name` to display in the :guilabel:`Layers Panel`;
the :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference System`:
Displays the layer's
:ref:`Coordinate Reference System (CRS) <layer_crs>`.
You can change the layer's CRS, by selecting a recently used one in
the drop-down list or clicking on the 
Select CRS button (see :ref:`crs_selector`).
Use this process only if the layer CRS is wrong or not specified.



Symbology Properties


3D Tile Layer Symbology

By default, the layer is styled using texture, but you can change it
to see the wireframe mesh behind the scene by choosing :guilabel:`Wireframe`
in the drop-down menu. You can also, change the mesh fill and line symbols
similar to the vector polygons.
Checking  :guilabel:`Use texture colors` will render each mesh element
with the average value of the full texture.
This is a good option to try when dealing with a large dataset and
want to get a quick overview of the data.


3D Tiles - textured and wireframe

To view the data you can open  :guilabel:`New 3D map view`.


3D Map View

From the :guilabel:`Symbology` tab, you can also set some options that
invariably act on all features of the layer:

:guilabel:`Maximum error`: This parameter determines the level of detail
displayed in the 3D model. Similar to point clouds, 3D tiles
often contain more information than necessary for visual representation.
By adjusting this setting, you control the balance between display density
and rendering speed. A larger value (e.g., 5 mm) may introduce noticeable
gaps between elements, while a smaller value (e.g., 0.1 mm) could lead to
the rendering of an excessive number of details, potentially slowing down
the rendering process. Different units can be selected to tailor the setting
to your specific needs.
:guilabel:`Opacity`: Adjust the visibility of the underlying layer on the
map canvas using this tool. Use slider to tailor the visibility
of your scene layer according to your preferences. Alternatively, specify the
exact percentage of visibility through the menu next to the slider.
:guilabel:`Blending mode`: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools
that you may previously only know from graphics programs.
The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying layers are mixed through the settings
described in :ref:`blend-modes`.



3D View Properties

:guilabel:`Maximum screen space error` determines the threshold for swapping
terrain tiles with more detailed ones (and vice versa) - i.e. how soon the 3D
view will use higher quality tiles. Lower numbers mean more details in the
scene at the expenses of increased rendering complexity.
 :guilabel:`Show bounding boxes` Show 3D bounding boxes of the
terrain tiles (useful for troubleshooting terrain issues).



Rendering Properties
Under  :guilabel:`Scale dependent visibility`,
you can set the :guilabel:`Maximum (inclusive)`
and :guilabel:`Minimum (exclusive)` scales,
defining a range of scales in which features will be visible.
Out of this range, they are hidden.
The  Set to current canvas scale button helps you
use the current map canvas scale as boundary of the range visibility.
See :ref:`label_scaledepend` for more information.


Elevation Properties
The  :guilabel:`Elevation` tab provides options to control
the layer elevation properties within a :ref:`3D map view <label_3dmapview>`.
Specifically, you can set:

:guilabel:`Elevation Surface`: how the 3D layer vertices Z values
should be interpreted as terrain elevation.
You can apply a :guilabel:`Scale` factor and an :guilabel:`Offset`.



Metadata Properties
The  :guilabel:`Metadata` tab provides you with options
to create and edit a metadata report on your layer.
See :ref:`metadatamenu` for more information.
