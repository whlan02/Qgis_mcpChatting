2D Map View
The 2D map view (also called Map canvas) is the central place where maps are displayed.
QGIS opens by default with a single map view (called main map),
showing layers in 2D, and tightly bound to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel.
That window reflects the rendering (symbology, labeling, visibilities...)
you applied to the loaded layers.


QGIS GUI


Exploring the map view
When you add a layer (see e.g. :ref:`opening_data`), QGIS automatically
looks for its CRS. If a different CRS is set by default for the project
(see :ref:`project_crs`) then the layer extent is "on-the-fly"
translated to that CRS, and the map view is zoomed to that extent if
you start with a blank QGIS project.
If there are already layers in the project, no map canvas resize is
performed, so only features falling within the current map canvas extent
will be visible.
Click on the map view and you should be able to interact with it,
panning or zooming to different areas of the map.
Dedicated tools are provided in the :guilabel:`Navigation Toolbar` and
in the :menuselection:`View` menu, with handful shortcuts from the keyboard
or the mouse buttons.

area. Not compatible with active selection or edit tools.





Right-click over the map and you should be able to 
:guilabel:`Copy coordinates` of the clicked point in the map CRS, in WGS84
or in a custom CRS. The copied information can then be pasted in an expression,
a script, text editor or spreadsheet...


Controlling map rendering
By default, QGIS renders all visible layers whenever the map canvas is
refreshed. The events that trigger a refresh of the map canvas include:

changing the visibility of a layer
modifying symbology of a visible layer
adding a layer
panning or zooming
resizing the QGIS window

QGIS allows you to control the rendering process in a number of ways.

at the :ref:`global level <rendering_options>`
per layer, using e.g. the :ref:`scale dependent rendering <label_scaledepend>`
or with dedicated tools in the GUI.

To stop the map drawing, press the :kbd:`Esc` key. This will halt the refresh of
the map canvas and leave the map partially drawn. It may however take a bit of time
after pressing :kbd:`Esc` for the map drawing to halt.
To suspend rendering, click the  :guilabel:`Render` checkbox in the
bottom-right corner of the status bar. When  :guilabel:`Render`
is unchecked, QGIS does not redraw the canvas in response to any of
the usual triggers mentioned earlier. Examples of when you
might want to suspend rendering include:

adding many layers and symbolizing them prior to drawing
adding one or more large layers and setting scale dependency before drawing
adding one or more large layers and zooming to a specific view before drawing
any combination of the above

Checking the  :guilabel:`Render` checkbox enables rendering and
causes an immediate refresh of the map canvas.


Time-based control on the map canvas
QGIS can handle temporal control on loaded layers, i.e. modify the map canvas
rendering based on a time variation. To achieve this, you need:

Layers that have dynamic temporal properties set.
QGIS supports temporal control for different data providers, with custom settings.
It's mainly about setting the time range in which the layer would display:

:ref:`raster layers <raster_temporal>`: controls whether to display or
not the layer.
:ref:`WMTS layers <wmts_temporal>`: controls whether the data should be rendered
based on a static time range or following a dynamic temporal range
:ref:`vector layers <vectortemporalmenu>`: features are filtered based
on time values associated to their attributes
:ref:`mesh layers <meshtemporal>`: displays dynamically the active dataset
groups values

When dynamic temporal options are enabled for a layer, an 
icon is displayed next to the layer in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel to remind
you that the layer is temporally controlled.
Click the icon to update the temporal settings.

Enable the temporal navigation of the map canvas using the :ref:`Temporal
controller panel <temporal_controller>`. The panel is activated:

using the  Temporal controller panel icon located in the
:guilabel:`Map Navigation` toolbar
or from the :menuselection:`View --> Panels --> Temporal controller panel`
menu
or from the :menuselection:`View --> Data Filtering --> Temporal controller panel`
menu




The temporal controller panel
The :guilabel:`Temporal controller` panel has the following modes:


Temporal Controller Panel in navigation mode


 Turn off temporal navigation: all the
temporal settings are disabled and visible layers are rendered as usual
 Fixed range temporal navigation:
a time range is set and only layers (or features) whose temporal range
overlaps with this range are displayed on the map.
 Animated temporal navigation:
a time range is set, split into steps, and only layers (or features)
whose temporal range overlaps with each frame are displayed on the map
 Animated movie:
a total number of frames is set for the animation, with the map settings
advancing at each step, displaying the progression frame by frame without
any time-based filtering of data.
 Settings for general control of the animation
:guilabel:`Frames rate`: number of steps that are shown per second
 :guilabel:`Cumulative range`: all animation frames will
have the same start date-time but different end dates and times.
This is useful if you wish to accumulate data in your temporal
visualization instead of showing a ‘moving time window’ across your data.





Animating a temporal navigation
An animation is based on a varying set of visible layers at particular times
within a time range.
To create a temporal animation:

Toggle on the  Animated temporal
navigation, displaying the animation player widget

Enter the :guilabel:`Time range` to consider. Using the 
button, this can be defined as:

:guilabel:`Set to full range` of all the time enabled layers
:guilabel:`Set to preset project range` as defined in the :ref:`project
properties <project_temporal>`
:guilabel:`Set to single layer's range` taken from a time-enabled layer


Fill in the time :guilabel:`Step` to split the time range.
Different units are supported, from seconds to centuries.
A source timestamps option is also available as step: when selected,
this causes the temporal navigation to step between all available time ranges
from layers in the project. It’s useful when a project contains layers with
non-contiguous available times, such as a WMS-T service which provides images
that are available at irregular dates. This option will allow you to only step
between time ranges where the next available image is shown.

Click the  button to preview the animation.
QGIS will generate scenes using the layers rendering at the set times.
Layers display depends on whether they overlap any individual time frame.
The animation can also be previewed by moving the time slider.
Checking the  :guilabel:`Loop` checkbox will repeatedly run the
animation while clicking  stops a running animation.
A full set of video player buttons is available.
Horizontal scrolling using the mouse wheel (where supported) with the
cursor on the map canvas will also allow you to navigate, or “scrub”,
the temporal navigation slider backwards and forwards.

Click the  Export animation button if you want to generate
a series of images representing the scene. They can be later combined in a
video editor software:


Exporting map canvas animation scenes to images


The filename :guilabel:`Template`: the #### are replaced with frame
sequence number
The :guilabel:`Output directory`
Under :guilabel:`Map settings`, you can:
redefine the :ref:`spatial extent <extent_selector>` to use
control the :guilabel:`Resolution` of the image
(:guilabel:`Output width` and :guilabel:`Output height`)
:guilabel:`Draw active decorations`: whether active :ref:`decorations
<decorations>` should be kept in the output


Under :guilabel:`Temporal settings`, you can redefine:
the time :guilabel:`Range` for the animation
the :guilabel:`Step (frame length)` in the unit of your choice








The Elevation Controller panel
 :guilabel:`Elevation Controller` allows you to handle elevation z-range data in 2D maps.
This option currently supports point cloud layers and raster DEMs.
Use the panel to visualize and interact with elevation data in the map canvas.
Activate the  :guilabel:`Elevation Controller` panel in the map canvas by
clicking on the :guilabel:`Data Filtering` in the :guilabel:`View` menu. The
 :guilabel:`Elevation Controller` appears as a range slider on the left
side of the map canvas. At the top of the slider, there is a  Settings menu
where you can:

Set the :guilabel:`Fixed Range Size` value to lock the elevation range to a specific size.
This setting is saved within the project and retained across sessions, ensuring consistency
for your elevation filter. Use the  :guilabel:`Invert Direction` option to reverse
the elevation filter slider, so that it moves from high values at the bottom to low values at the top.
:guilabel:`Set Elevation Range` to open the project elevation tab, where you can set dedicated lower and upper bounds for the elevation range
:guilabel:`Disable Elevation Filter` to remove the elevation filter from the map canvas



Bookmarking extents on the map
Spatial Bookmarks allow you to "bookmark" a geographic location and return to
it later. By default, bookmarks are saved in the user's profile (as :guilabel:`User
Bookmarks`), meaning that they are available from any project the user opens.
They can also be saved for a single project (named
:guilabel:`Project Bookmarks`) and stored within the project file, which can
be helpful if the project is to be shared with other users.

Creating a Bookmark
To create a bookmark:

Zoom and pan to the area of interest.

Select the menu option :menuselection:`View -->` 
:menuselection:`New Spatial Bookmark...`,
press :kbd:`Ctrl+B` or right-click the  :guilabel:`Spatial
Bookmarks` entry in
the :guilabel:`Browser` panel and select :guilabel:`New Spatial Bookmark`.
The :guilabel:`Bookmark Editor` dialog opens.


The Bookmark Editor Dialog


Enter a descriptive name for the bookmark

Enter or select a group name in which to store related bookmarks

Select the extent of the area you wish to save, using the :ref:`extent selector
<extent_selector>` widget

Change the map :guilabel:`Rotation`

Indicate the :guilabel:`CRS` to use for the extent

Select whether the bookmark will be :guilabel:`Saved in` :guilabel:`User
Bookmarks` or :guilabel:`Project Bookmarks` (by default, this drop-down list
is set to :guilabel:`User Bookmarks`)

Press :guilabel:`Save` to add the bookmark to the list


Note that you can have multiple bookmarks with the same name.


Working with Bookmarks
To use and manage bookmarks, you can either use the :guilabel:`Spatial Bookmarks`
panel or :guilabel:`Browser`.
Select :menuselection:`View -->`  :menuselection:`Show Spatial
Bookmark Manager` or press :kbd:`Ctrl+7`
to open the :guilabel:`Spatial Bookmarks Manager` panel.
Select :menuselection:`View -->`  :menuselection:`Show Bookmarks`

project) and subfolders (groups).




You can manage bookmark actions by right-click on the desired bookmark in the
:guilabel:`Spatial Bookmarks Manager`. You can also zoom to bookmarks by typing the
bookmark name in the :ref:`locator <label_statusbar>`.



Decorating the map
Decorations include Grid, Title Label, Copyright Label, Image, North Arrow, Scale Bar and Layout
Extents. They are used to 'decorate' the map by adding cartographic elements.

Grid
 :guilabel:`Grid` allows you to add a coordinate grid and coordinate
annotations to the map canvas.

Select menu option :menuselection:`View --> Decorations --> Grid...` to open the dialog.


The Grid Dialog


Tick  :guilabel:`Enable grid` and set grid
definitions according to the layers loaded in the map canvas:

The :guilabel:`Grid type`: it can be :guilabel:`Line` or :guilabel:`Marker`
The associated :ref:`Line symbol <vector_line_symbols>` or :ref:`marker
symbol <vector_marker_symbols>` used to represent the grid marks
The :guilabel:`Interval X` and :guilabel:`Interval Y` between the grid
marks, in map units
An :guilabel:`Offset X` and :guilabel:`Offset Y` distance of the grid
marks from the bottom left corner of the map canvas, in map units
The interval and offset parameters can be set based on the:
:guilabel:`Canvas Extents`: generates a grid with an interval that is
approximatively 1/5 of the canvas width
:guilabel:`Active Raster Layer` resolution




Tick  :guilabel:`Draw annotations` to display the coordinates of
the grid marks and set:

The :guilabel:`Annotation direction`, ie how the labels would be placed
relative to their grid line. It can be:
:guilabel:`Horizontal` or :guilabel:`Vertical` for all the labels
:guilabel:`Horizontal and Vertical`, ie each label is parallel to the
grid mark it refers to
:guilabel:`Boundary direction`, ie each label follows the canvas
boundary, and is perpendicular to the grid mark it refers to


The :guilabel:`Annotation font` (text formatting, buffer, shadow...) using
the :ref:`font selector widget <font_selector>`
The :guilabel:`Distance to map frame`, margin between annotations and map
canvas limits. Convenient when :ref:`exporting the map canvas <exportingmapcanvas>`

Tip
Decorations Settings
When you save a QGIS project file, any changes you have made to Grid,
North Arrow, Scale Bar, Copyright and Layout Extents will be saved in the project and restored
the next time you load the project.




Annotation Tools
Annotations are another type of elements added onto the map canvas to provide
additional information that can not be depicted by the rendered layers.
Unlike :ref:`labels <vector_labels_tab>` that rely on attribute values stored
in vector layers, annotations are independent details, stored within the project
file itself.
Two families of annotations are available in QGIS:

Feature annotations: they are actual georeferenced features of text, marker,
line or polygon type stored within a special layer type called "annotation layer".
They are tied to a particular geographic location, meaning that moving your map,
changing the scale or changing projection won’t cause your annotations to jump
around the map. Rather, they’ll be locked in place to the location you’ve drawn them.
Balloon annotations: these are individual HTML or form annotations inside a bubble.
They can be associated to any layer for their visibility and drawn on top of the map canvas.
The size is dependent from the map canvas scale, and its position can be anchored.


Tip
Layout the map with annotations
You can print or export annotations with your map to various formats using:

map canvas export tools available in the :menuselection:`Project` menu
:ref:`print layout <create-output>`, in which case you need to check
:guilabel:`Draw map canvas items` in the corresponding map item properties


The :guilabel:`Annotations Toolbar` provides a set of tools to create and interact
with both families of annotations.

The Annotations Toolbar actions

Note
Starting with QGIS 3.40, it is no longer possible to create balloon annotations of SVG or text type.
When loading old projects, any of these annotations will automatically be converted
to the newer picture and rectangular text annotation item types.


Feature Annotations
Feature annotations are stored in annotation layers. Unlike conventional
layers, an annotation layer is available only in the current project and can
contain features of different types (text, marker, line, polygon, picture).
The layer has no attributes and no symbology associated, but instead each feature
can be symbolized on an item-by-item basis, through :guilabel:`Layer Styling` panel.
Two types of annotation layer are available in QGIS:

A common :guilabel:`Annotation Layer`: you can create one using
the  New Annotation Layer tool. It is listed
in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel, allowing you to control its features' visibility,
move it to show above or below particular layers in your map, like any common layer.
Double-click the layer and you can access its properties.
The :guilabel:`Main Annotation Layer`: By default, this is where annotations
are stored when no annotation layer is available in the project or is selected
at creation time. This layer is always drawn on the very top of your map and
you won't see it listed in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel alongside the other
layers in your project, meaning that its features are always visible.
The :guilabel:`Main Annotation Layer Properties` entry on
the :guilabel:`Annotations` toolbar helps you open its properties dialog.


Layer Properties
The properties dialog of an annotation layer provides the following tabs:

:guilabel:`Information`: a read-only dialog representing an interesting
place to quickly grab summarized information and metadata on the current layer.
This may include the layer extent, count of items per annotation type and total count,
CRS details, ...
:guilabel:`Source`: defines general settings for the annotation layer. You can:
Set a :guilabel:`Layer name` that will be used to identify the layer
in the project (in the :guilabel:`Layers Panel`, with expressions, ...)
Display the layer's :ref:`Assigned Coordinate Reference System (CRS) <layer_crs>`:
you can change the layer's CRS, selecting a recently used one
in the drop-down list or clicking on  Select CRS button
(see :ref:`crs_selector`). Use this process only if the CRS applied to the
layer is a wrong one or if none was applied.




:guilabel:`Rendering`:

You can set the :guilabel:`Maximum (inclusive)` and :guilabel:`Minimum
(exclusive)` scale, defining a range of scale in which features will be
visible. Out of this range, they are hidden. The 
Set to current canvas scale button helps you use the current map
canvas scale as boundary of the range visibility.
See :ref:`label_scaledepend` for more information.
:guilabel:`Linked layer`: allows you to optionally set a linked visibility
layer for the annotation layer.
If set, then the annotations will only be drawn when the linked layer is visible
in the map.
:guilabel:`Opacity`: You can make the underlying layer in
the map canvas visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility
of your vector layer to your needs. You can also make a precise definition of
the percentage of visibility in the menu beside the slider.
:guilabel:`Blending mode` at the :guilabel:`Layer` level: You can achieve
special rendering effects with these tools that you may previously only
know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlying
layers are mixed through the settings described in :ref:`blend-modes`.
Apply :ref:`paint effects <draw_effects>` on all the layer features with the
:guilabel:`Draw Effects` button.

Some of these options are accessible from the feature annotation
:guilabel:`Symbology` properties.




Interacting with features
The Feature annotations have dedicated tools for creation depending on their type.

 Create Polygon Annotation
This is like digitizing a point, line or polygon vector feature.
All the usual shortcuts for creating features apply when creating annotation items.
A line or polygon annotation is drawn by left-clicking once for each vertex,
with a final right mouse click to complete the shape. Snapping can be enabled
while you draw, you can use the :guilabel:`Advanced Digitizing Tools` to precisely
place vertices, and even switch the :ref:`drawing tools <drawing_methods>`
to for example the streaming mode for completely free-form shapes.

Draw the rectangle box of the text, by left-clicking to add a first corner
and left-clicking again to add the opposite one.

Picture
 Create Picture Annotation
Draw the rectangle box of the picture, by left-clicking to add a first corner
and left-clicking again to add the opposite one.
Then pick an image or SVG file from the file explorer.



Unlike common layers, an annotation layer does not need to be active before you
select its features. Simply grab the  Modify Annotations tool and
you will be able to interact with any feature annotation:

Selection: left-click on the annotation.
By default, annotations are rendered in the order of creation,
meaning that recent annotations will be placed on top of older.
You may need to play with the Z-index property of features in order to select
ones they would sit above.
Moving: Left click on a selected annotation item to start moving it.
A right-click or pressing :kbd:`Esc` key cancels the move, while a second
left click will confirm the move.
The displacement can also be controlled pressing the cursor keys:
:kbd:`Shift+key` for big movement
:kbd:`Alt+key` for 1 px movement


Geometry modification: move over an annotation and purple squares are displayed
on nodes of its underlying geometry.
Left-click on the square, move and click again.
For linear or polygonal annotations, double-clicking a segment will add a new vertex.
Delete: Pressing the :kbd:`Del` or :kbd:`Backspace` key while
an annotation is selected will delete that annotation
:ref:`Change feature symbology <annotation_feature_symbology>`



Feature symbology
A selected annotation will display its :guilabel:`Symbology` properties
in the :guilabel:`Layer styling` panel.

For polygon, polyline and marker annotations, you can modify the appearance
using full capabilities of the :ref:`symbol properties <symbol-selector>`

For text-based annotations, an area with text editing tools helps you construct the string to display.
It can be multiline, use HTML formatting and rely on QGIS expression functions.
You can moreover modify the appearance using full capabilities
of the :ref:`text format properties <text_format>`.
Depending on the type of annotation, additional options are available.

For text annotation at point, it is also possible to:
set the text :guilabel:`Alignment` (left, center or right of the anchor point)
configure whether the text should :guilabel:`Ignore map rotation` or :guilabel:`Rotate with map`.
In both cases, a custom :guilabel:`Angle` can be set for the feature orientation.


For text annotation along a line, configure an :guilabel:`Offset from line` in the unit
of your choice
For text annotation in rectangle, it is also possible to:
set the text :guilabel:`Horizontal alignment` (left, center, right or justify)
and :guilabel:`Vertical alignment` (top, vertical center or bottom) in the rectangle box
configure for the rectangle, the :guilabel:`Margins` distance in the units of your choice,
the :guilabel:`Frame` and :guilabel:`Background` colors.




Picture annotations allow you to display a :guilabel:`Raster image` or an :guilabel:`SVG image`,
using the :ref:`embedded_file_selector`.
The placement and size of the picture can be set as :guilabel:`Scale dependent size`,
:guilabel:`Fixed size` or :guilabel:`Relative to map`.
Moreover, you can enable display of the :guilabel:`Frame` and :guilabel:`Background` of the rectangle box,
and configure them using :ref:`fill symbols <vector_fill_symbols>`.

For text at point, text inside rectangle and picture annotations, you can :guilabel:`Show callout`
when the picture or text anchor point is offset from its default placement.
To create a callout for an annotation:

Select the annotation item
Move the anchor point, i.e., click the central and green :kbd:`X` node and click at the new placement
In the annotation properties, press the :guilabel:`...` button to configure
the :ref:`callout properties <labels_callouts>`.


Tip
Applying a balloon callout to a text or picture annotation
will make you get their old-style balloon annotation display.


Configure a  :guilabel:`Reference scale`: indicates the map scale
at which symbol or text sizes which use paper-based units (such as millimeters or points) relate to.
The sizes will be scaled accordingly whenever the map is viewed at a different scale.
For instance, a line feature wide of 2mm at 1:2000 :guilabel:`Reference scale`
will be rendered using 4mm when the map is viewed at 1:1000.

Set a :guilabel:`Z-index`: a feature with a higher index is placed on top of
features with lower index.
A convenient setting for both feature display and selection.

Modify some of the :ref:`Layer rendering <annotationslayer_rendering>` settings





Balloon annotations
You can add balloon annotations through :menuselection:`Edit --> Add Annotation -->`
menu or from the :guilabel:`Annotations Toolbar`:

 HTML Annotation to place the content of an :file:`html` file

 Form Annotation: useful to display attributes
of a vector layer in a customized :file:`ui` file (see :numref:`figure_custom_annotation`).
This is similar to the :ref:`custom attribute forms <provide_ui_file>`,
but displayed in an annotation item.
Also watch this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDBuSbQ02o&feature=youtu.be&t=2m25s>
from Tim Sutton for more information.




Examples of balloon annotations

To add a balloon annotation, select the corresponding tool and click on the map canvas.
An empty balloon is added. Double-click on it and a dialog opens with various
options. This dialog is almost the same for all the annotation types:

At the top, a file selector to fill with the path to an :file:`html` or :file:`ui` file
depending on the type of annotation.
 :guilabel:`Fixed map position`: when unchecked, the balloon placement
is based on a screen position (instead of the map), meaning that it's always shown
regardless the map canvas extent.
:guilabel:`Linked layer`: associates the annotation with a map layer, making it
visible only when that layer is visible.
:guilabel:`Map marker`: using :ref:`QGIS symbols <symbol-selector>`,
sets the symbol to display at the balloon anchor position (shown only when
:guilabel:`Fixed map position` is checked).
:guilabel:`Frame style`: sets the frame background color, transparency,
stroke color or width of the balloon using QGIS symbols.
:guilabel:`Contents margins`: sets interior margins of the annotation frame.
 :guilabel:`Live update` allows you to live preview your changes.



A ballon annotation text dialog

When a balloon annotation tool is active, you can also:

Select an annotation
Resize an annotation
Move an annotation by map position (by dragging the map marker) or by moving only the balloon.
Delete an annotation: select it and either press the :kbd:`Del` or :kbd:`Backspace` button,
or double-click it and press the :guilabel:`Delete` button in the properties dialog.
Right-click and in the contextual menu:
 :guilabel:`Copy coordinate` of the annotation's map marker in various CRS
 :guilabel:`Edit` properties of the annotation. Same as double-clicking the annotation.
 :guilabel:`Delete` the annotation






Measuring

General information
QGIS provides four means of measuring geometries:

interactive measurement tools 
measuring in the  Field Calculator
derived measurements in the :ref:`identify` tool
the vector analysis tool: :menuselection:`Vector --> Geometry Tools -->
Export/Add Geometry Columns`

Measuring works within projected coordinate systems (e.g., UTM) and unprojected
data. The first three measuring tools behave equally to global project settings:

Unlike most other GIS, the default measurement metric is
ellipsoidal, using the ellipsoid defined in
:menuselection:`Project --> Properties... --> General`. This is true both
when geographic and projected coordinate systems are defined for the project.
If you want to calculate the projected/planimetric area or distance using cartesian
maths, the measurement ellipsoid has to be set to "None/Planimetric"
(:menuselection:`Project --> Properties... --> General`). However,
with a geographic (ie unprojected) CRS defined for the data and project, area and
distance measurement will be ellipsoidal.

However, neither the identify tool nor the field calculator will transform your
data to the project CRS before measuring. If you want to achieve this, you have
to use the vector analysis tool: :menuselection:`Vector --> Geometry Tools -->
Add Geometry Attributes...`. Here, measurement is planimetric, unless
you choose the ellipsoidal measurement.


Measure length, areas, bearings and angles interactively
Click the  icon in the Attribute toolbar to begin measurements.
The down arrow near the icon switches between
 length,  area,  bearing or  angle.
The default unit used in the dialog is the one set in :menuselection:`Project -->
Properties... --> General` menu.
For the :guilabel:`Measure Line` and the :guilabel:`Measure Area` the
measurements can be done in  :guilabel:`Cartesian` or
 :guilabel:`Ellipsoidal` measure.

Note
Configuring the measure tool
While measuring length or area, clicking the :guilabel:`Configuration` button
at the bottom of the widget opens the :menuselection:`Settings -->
Options --> Map Tools` menu, where you can select the rubberband color, the
precision of the measurements and the unit behavior. You can also choose your
preferred measurement or angle units, but keep in mind that those values are
overridden in the current project by the selection made in the
:menuselection:`Project --> Properties... --> General` menu, and by the
selection made in the measurement widget.

All measuring modules use the snapping settings from the digitizing module
(see section :ref:`snapping_tolerance`).
So, if you want to measure exactly along a line feature, or around a polygon feature,
first set its layer snapping tolerance.
Now, when using the measuring tools, each mouse click (within the tolerance setting)
will snap to that layer.
The  Measure Line measures distances between given points.
The tool then allows you to click points on the map.
Each segment length, as well as the total, shows up in the measure window.
In the measure window, you will see coordinates for all your points and distances.
Keep in mind that the first row will contain only coordinates, as it represents your starting point.
Now it is possible to copy all your line measurements at once to the clipboard
using the :guilabel:`Copy` button. Clicking the :guilabel:`Configuration` button
you will access to :guilabel:`Measure Tool Copy Settings` where you can set up
:ref:`copy options <measure_copy_settings>`. To stop measuring, click the right
mouse button.
Note that you can use the drop-down list near the total
to change the :ref:`measurement units <measurements_ellipsoid>`
interactively while working with the measure tool.
This unit is retained for the widget until a new project is created
or another project is opened.
The :guilabel:`Info` section in the dialog explains how calculations are made
according to the CRS settings available.


Measure Distance

 Measure Area: Areas can also be measured. In the
measure window, the accumulated area size appears. Right-click to stop drawing.
The Info section is also available as well as the ability to switch between
different :ref:`area units <measurements_ellipsoid>`.


Measure Area

 Measure Bearing: You can also measure bearings.
The cursor becomes cross-shaped.
Click to draw the first point of the bearing,
then move the cursor to draw the second point.
The measurement is displayed in a pop-up dialog.


Measure Bearing

 Measure Angle: You can also measure angles.
The cursor becomes cross-shaped.
Click to draw the first segment of the angle you wish to measure,
then move the cursor to draw the desired angle.
The measurement is displayed in a pop-up dialog.


Measure Angle




Setting additional map views
It is also possible to open additional map views whose content could diverge
from the :guilabel:`Layers` panel current state.
To add a new map view, go to :menuselection:`View -->` 
:menuselection:`New Map View`. A new floating widget, mimicking the main map
view's rendering, is added to QGIS. You can add as many map views as you need.
They can be kept floating, placed side by side or stacked on top of each
other.


Multiple map views with different settings

At the top of an additional map canvas, there's a toolbar with the following
capabilities:

 Zoom Full,  Zoom to Selection
and  Zoom to Layer(s) to navigate within the view
 Set View Theme to select the :ref:`map theme <map_themes>`
to display in the map view. If set to (none), the view will follow
the :guilabel:`Layers` panel changes.
 View settings to configure the map view:
 :guilabel:`Synchronize view center with main map`:
syncs the center of the map views without changing the scale.
This allows you to have an overview style or magnified map which follows
the main canvas center.
 :guilabel:`Synchronize view to selection`: same as
zoom to selection
:guilabel:`Scale`
:guilabel:`Rotation`
:guilabel:`Magnification`
 :guilabel:`Synchronize scale` with the main map scale.
A :guilabel:`Scale factor` can then be applied, allowing you to have
a view which is e.g. always 2x the scale of the main canvas.
 :guilabel:`Show annotations`
 :guilabel:`Show cursor position`
 :guilabel:`Show main canvas extent`
 :guilabel:`Show labels`: allows to hide labels regardless
they are set in the displayed layers' properties
:guilabel:`Change map CRS...`
:guilabel:`Rename view...`





Exporting the map view
Maps you make can be layout and exported to various formats using the
advanced capabilities of the
:ref:`print layout or report <label_printlayout>`.
It's also possible to directly export the current rendering, without
a layout.
This quick "screenshot" of the map view has some convenient features.
To export the map canvas with the current rendering:

Go to :menuselection:`Project --> Import/Export`
Depending on your output format, select either
 :guilabel:`Export Map to Image...`
or  :guilabel:`Export Map to PDF...`



The two tools provide you with a common set of options.
In the dialog that opens:


The Save Map as Image dialog


Choose the :guilabel:`Extent` to export: it can be the current
view extent (the default), the extent of a layer or a custom extent
drawn over the map canvas.
Coordinates of the selected area are displayed and manually editable.

Enter the :guilabel:`Scale` of the map or select it from the
:ref:`predefined scales <predefinedscales>`: changing the scale will
resize the extent to export (from the center).

Set the :guilabel:`Resolution` of the output

Control the :guilabel:`Output width` and :guilabel:`Output height`
in pixels of the image: based by default on the current resolution
and extent, they can be customized and will resize the map extent
(from the center).
The size ratio can be locked, which may be particularly convenient
when drawing the extent on the canvas.

 :guilabel:`Draw active decorations`: in use
:ref:`decorations <decorations>` (scale bar, title, grid, north
arrow...) are exported with the map

 :guilabel:`Draw annotations` to export any :ref:`annotation
<sec_annotations>`

 :guilabel:`Append georeference information (embedded or
via world file)`: depending on the output format, a world file of
the same name (with extension PNGW for PNG images, JPGW
for JPG, ...) is saved in the same folder as your image.
The PDF format embeds the information in the PDF file.

When exporting to PDF, more options are available in the
:guilabel:`Save map as PDF...` dialog:


The Save Map as PDF dialog


 :guilabel:`Export RDF metadata` of the document such
as the title, author, date, description...

 :guilabel:`Create Geospatial PDF`: Generate a
georeferenced PDF file.
You can:

Choose the Geospatial PDF :guilabel:`Format`
 :guilabel:`Include vector feature information` in the
Geospatial PDF file: will include all the geometry and attribute
information from features visible within the map in the output
Geospatial PDF file.


Note
A Geospatial PDF file can also be used as a data source.
For more on Geospatial PDF support in QGIS, see
https://north-road.com/2019/09/03/qgis-3-10-loves-geospatialpdf/.


:guilabel:`Rasterize map`

 :guilabel:`Simplify geometries to reduce output file size`:
Geometries will be simplified while exporting the map by removing
vertices that are not discernibly different at the export
resolution (e.g. if the export resolution is 300 dpi, vertices
that are less than 1/600 inch apart will be removed).
This can reduce the size and complexity of the export file (very
large files can fail to load in other applications).

Set the :guilabel:`Text export`: controls whether text labels are always
or preferably exported as :ref:`text or outline objects <render_labels_text>`.



Click :guilabel:`Save` to select file location, name and format.
When exporting to image, it's also possible to
:guilabel:`Copy to clipboard` the expected result of the above
settings and paste the map in another application such as
LibreOffice, GIMP...
