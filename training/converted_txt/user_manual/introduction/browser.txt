Resources


The QGIS Browser panel is a great tool for browsing, searching,
inspecting, copying and loading QGIS resources.
Only resources that QGIS knows how to handle are shown in the
browser.
Using the Browser panel you can locate, inspect and add data, as
described in :ref:`browser_panel`.
In addition, the Browser panel supports drag and drop of many QGIS
resources, such as project files, Python scripts, Processing scripts and
Processing models.
Python scripts, Processing scripts and Processing models can also be opened for
editing in an external editor and the graphical modeller.
You can drag and drop layers from the :guilabel:`Layers` panel
to the :guilabel:`Browser` panel, for instance into a GeoPackage or a
PostGIS database.


The Browser panel

The browser panel (:numref:`figure_browser_panel`) is organised
as an expandable hierarchy with some fixed top-level entries that
organise the resources handled by the browser.
Node entries are expanded by clicking on  to the left
of the entry name.
A branch is collapsed by clicking on .
The  Collapse All button collapses all top-level
entries.
In :menuselection:`Settings --> Interface Customization` it is
possible to disable resources.
If you, for instance, would not like to show Python scripts in the
browser, you can uncheck the :menuselection:`Browser --> py` entry,
and if you want to get rid of your home folder in the browser, you
can uncheck the :menuselection:`Browser --> special:Home` entry.
A filter ( Filter Browser) can be used for searching
based on entry names (both leaf entries and node entries in the
hierarchy).
Using the  Options pull-down menu next to the filter
text field, you can

toggle :guilabel:`Case Sensitive` search
set the :guilabel:`Filter pattern syntax` to one of
:guilabel:`Normal`
:guilabel:`Wildcard(s)`
:guilabel:`Regular Expressions`



The Properties widget, showing useful information about some
entries / resources, can be enabled / disabled using the 
Enable/disable properties widget button.
When enabled, it opens at the bottom of the browser panel, as shown in
:numref:`figure_properties_widget`.


The properties widget

A second browser panel can be opened by activating the
:guilabel:`Browser (2)` panel in :menuselection:`View --> Panels`.
Having two browser panels can be useful when copying layers between
resources that are locationed deep down in different branches of the
browser hierarchy.

Resources that can be opened / run from the Browser
A lot can be accomplished in the Browser panel

Add vector, raster and mesh layers to your map by double-clicking,
dragging onto the map canvas or clicking the 
Add Selected Layers button (after selecting layers)
Run Python scripts (including Processing algorithms) by
double-clicking or dragging onto the map canvas
Run models by double-clicking or dragging onto the map canvas
:guilabel:`Extract Symbols...` from QGIS Project files using the
context menu
Open files with their default applications
(:guilabel:`Open <file type> Externally...` in the context menu).
Examples: HTML files, spreadsheets, images, PDFs, text files, ...
Copy entries
Rename and delete (multiple) layers (context menu: :menuselection:`Manage -->`)
Open a file explorer window and directly select the file
:guilabel:`Show in Files`

Resource specific actions are listed for the different resource groups
sorted under the top-level entries listed below.


Browser panel top-level entries

Favorites
Often used file system locations can be tagged as favorites.
The ones you have tagged will appear here.
In addition to the operations described under Home, the
context menu allows you to :guilabel:`Rename Favorite...` and
:guilabel:`Remove Favorite`.


Spatial Bookmarks
This is where you will find your spatial bookmarks, organised
into :guilabel:`Project Bookmarks` and :guilabel:`User Bookmarks`.
From the top level context menu, you can create a bookmark
(:guilabel:`New Spatial Bookmark...`),
:guilabel:`Show the Spatial Bookmark Manager`,
:guilabel:`Import Spatial Bookmarks...` and
:guilabel:`Export Spatial Bookmarks...`.
For bookmark group entries you can :guilabel:`Export Spatial Bookmarks...`,
create a bookmark (:guilabel:`New Spatial Bookmark...`),
:guilabel:`Rename Bookmark Group`,
and :guilabel:`Delete Bookmark Group`.
For bookmark entries you can :guilabel:`Zoom to Bookmark`,
:guilabel:`Edit Spatial Bookmark...` and
:guilabel:`Delete Spatial Bookmark`


Project Home
Available once the project file has been saved, the :guilabel:`Project home`
entry is a folder containing data and other contents (scripts, models, text, ...)
that may be used within the current project.
Displayed in the :guilabel:`Browser` panel, it allows you to quickly
access data and other files of the project.
It defaults to the project file folder but can be changed through the
:menuselection:`Project --> Properties... --> General --> Project home` option,
or by right-clicking on the :guilabel:`Project Home` item of the Browser panel
and selecting :guilabel:`Set project home...`.
Customizing that folder is especially useful in contexts where QGIS projects
are not stored in the root folder of an organisational 'project', along with datasets.


Drives and file system
The next items of the :guilabel:`Browser` panel depend on the OS in use
and concern the top level entries of its file system.
They are mainly:

The :guilabel:`Home` folder, pointing to the current user home folder
on Unix-based machines, the root :guilabel:`/` folder
the connected drives, either local or network. Depending on the OS,
they are directly listed (eg, C:\, D:\) or through the /Volumes
entry.

From the contextual menu of each of these folders or drives, you can:

refresh the contents
create a :menuselection:`New -->` subitem that is a :guilabel:`Directory`,
:guilabel:`GeoPackage` or ESRI :guilabel:`Shapefile` format dataset
hide the directory (:guilabel:`Hide from Browser`)
:guilabel:`Set color`: customize the folder icon color, aiding in rapid
browser navigation of complex folder structures
enable :guilabel:`Scanning`:
 :guilabel:`Monitor for changes`: allows to manually control
whether a particular directory should be monitored and automatically updated.
This setting applies to the selected directory and all subdirectories.
This means that you can manually opt-in to monitoring of network drives
if you know there's no issue, or manually opt-out of monitoring of large
directories which you don't want monitored for other reasons.
By default, remote or network drives are not automatically monitored.
 :guilabel:`Fast scan this directory`


open the directory in your file manager (:guilabel:`Open Directory...`)
open the directory in a terminal window  (:guilabel:`Open in Terminal...`)
inspect the :guilabel:`Properties...` or the parent :guilabel:`Directory
Properties...`



Database entries
Depending on your OS and installed drivers, you might have access to different database
types to use in QGIS. Below are listed the different entries of contextual menu at
each level of the dataset tree.

[1]The different entries may also be available for some GDAL supported
vector file formats
such as ESRI File Geodatabase, FlatGeobuf, GeoParquet, NetCDF, ... when compatible.



Note
When loading vector layers into QGIS, fields with  :guilabel:`Field Domains`
(such as those defined in a GeoPackage or ESRI File Geodatabase) are automatically
detected. These domains are database-level constraints, meaning they are enforced
by the database itself and apply across different applications, not just QGIS.
